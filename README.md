This Project is created to help find the Absentees during online classes through Microsoft Teams. This project consists of two apps:
•	Detailed Absentee Generator: This App helps to process multiple files (up to 10) at a time and compare it with a user given main file to give the absentees. The report is exported as an excel file where the absentees are sorted date wise.
•	Quick Absentee Generator: This app helps to compare one file with the user given main file to give the absentees quickly on the same app instead of exporting it to Excel.
•	The Project is designed for files generated by MS Teams and hence might not work for other files
•	It is better to use the attendance file downloaded directly from MS Teams instead of opening it and editing it
•	The main file should be in the same format like the attendance file from teams
Download The files:-
main.py is for detailed absentee genrator
